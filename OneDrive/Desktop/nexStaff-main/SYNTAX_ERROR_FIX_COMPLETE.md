# Syntax Error Fix - Complete ✅

## Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected string" at dashboard.html:2583
- **Root Cause**: Orphaned `case` statements that were not part of a valid switch block
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Orphaned Case Statements
**Location**: `login/admin/dashboard.html` lines 2579-2583
**Fix**: Removed duplicate case statements that were outside of any switch block:
```javascript
// REMOVED THESE ORPHANED LINES:
case 'applications':
    this.loadApplications();
    break;
case 'schedule':
    this.loadSchedules();
    break;
}
```

### 2. Fixed Class Declaration Formatting
**Location**: `login/admin/dashboard.html` around line 3350
**Fix**: Properly closed previous function and formatted FormControlManager class declaration:
```javascript
// BEFORE (malformed):
}        }
// Form Control Manager - Makes all form-control elements functional        class FormControlManager {

// AFTER (correct):
}
}

// Form Control Manager - Makes all form-control elements functional
class FormControlManager {
```
