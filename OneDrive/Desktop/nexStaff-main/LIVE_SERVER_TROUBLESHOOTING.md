## Issue: Live Server Still Not Auto-Reloading

I've updated your configuration and here are the exact steps to fix the persistent auto-reload issue:

## ‚úÖ Changes Made:
1. **Changed port** from 5500 to 5501 (avoids conflicts)
2. **Updated host** to 127.0.0.1 (more reliable than localhost)
3. **Increased wait time** from 100ms to 500ms (more stable)
4. **Killed Python server** that was running on port 8000 (potential conflict)
5. **Fixed proxy configuration** that was causing JSON errors

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Fix:

### Step 1: Restart VS Code Completely
1. Close VS Code entirely
2. End any VS Code processes in Task Manager if needed
3. Reopen VS Code and your project

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open your browser (Opera GX)
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
3. Clear "Cached images and files"
4. Close all browser tabs

### Step 3: Test Live Server
1. **Right-click** on `index.html`
2. Select **"Open with Live Server"**
3. Browser should open with URL: `http://127.0.0.1:5501/`
4. Make a small change to `index.html` (add a space somewhere)
5. Save the file (`Ctrl + S`)
6. Browser should auto-refresh within 1-2 seconds

### Step 4: If Still Not Working

#### Option A: Manual Port Check
```powershell
# Check what's using your ports
netstat -ano | findstr :5501
netstat -ano | findstr :5500
```
If anything shows up, kill those processes.

#### Option B: Reset Live Server
1. Click the port number in VS Code status bar (bottom right)
2. This stops Live Server
3. Start Live Server again by right-clicking HTML file

#### Option C: Alternative Test File
Create a simple test file to isolate the issue:

1. Create `test.html` in your root folder:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Live Server Test</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Testing Live Server</h1>
    <p>This should auto-reload when changed!</p>
</body>
</html>
```

2. Open this file with Live Server
3. Change the text and save
4. Check if it auto-reloads

## üîç Common Causes & Solutions:

### Issue: Port 5500 was busy
**Solution**: Now using port 5501 ‚úÖ

### Issue: Multiple servers running
**Solution**: Killed Python server that was conflicting ‚úÖ

### Issue: Browser caching aggressively
**Solution**: Use hard refresh `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Issue: Windows Firewall blocking
**Solution**: 
1. Windows Security ‚Üí Firewall & network protection
2. Allow an app through firewall
3. Add VS Code and your browser

### Issue: Antivirus interference
**Solution**: Temporarily disable antivirus and test

## üéØ Expected Behavior:
1. Save any HTML/CSS/JS file in your project
2. Browser refreshes automatically within 1-2 seconds
3. Changes appear immediately
4. Status bar shows "Port: 5501" when Live Server is running

## üö® Emergency Fix:
If nothing works, try this nuclear option:
1. Uninstall Live Server extension
2. Restart VS Code
3. Reinstall Live Server extension
4. Try again

Your settings are now optimized for reliability over speed. This should fix the auto-reload issue!
