# NexStaff Client-Admin Integration

## 🔗 **Data Connection Established!**

The NexStaff platform now has **seamless data flow** between the client-side (public pages) and admin-side (dashboard). Here's how the integration works:

## 📊 **Centralized Data Management**

### 🗄️ **DataManager (`client/js/dataManager.js`)**
- **Single source of truth** for all application data
- Handles CRUD operations for Jobs, Candidates, Employers, Applications, and Employees
- Stores data in localStorage with proper structure
- Provides formatted data for both client and admin views

### 🔄 **Real-Time Synchronization**
- Applications submitted on client pages **instantly appear** in admin dashboard
- Job postings created in admin **immediately show** on public job pages
- Candidate registrations **automatically sync** across the platform
- Changes in admin dashboard **reflect** on client pages within 30 seconds

## 🎯 **Connected Features**

### **1. Job Applications Flow**
```
Public Job Page → Apply Button → Application Form → Admin Dashboard
```
- User applies for job on `pages/jobs.html`
- Application data flows to admin `Applications` section
- Admin can review, approve/reject, and schedule interviews
- Status updates reflect in candidate's view

### **2. Job Management**
```
Admin Dashboard → Post Job → Public Job Listings
```
- Admin creates job in `Jobs` section
- Job appears on public job page with all details
- Application tracking works automatically
- Job status changes control public visibility

### **3. Candidate Pipeline**
```
Public Application → Candidate Profile → Interview Scheduling → Hiring
```
- Application creates/updates candidate profile

### **4. Employer Management**
```

```
